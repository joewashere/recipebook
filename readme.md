## RecipeBook
This is a recipe book built on Laravel. It can currently parse recipes from allrecipes.com and allow you to save them in an easy to manage recipe book. It uses a MySQL database to save the items and will allow you to add items to a grocery list, or add items you currently have to your fridge list. Also has the ability to pick favorite recipes.

I plan to add more support for other recipe sites as well as tie the shopping and fridge lists into your saved recipes to allow you to search for recipes that have items currently in your fridge, or allow you to add items missing from your fridge to your shopping list.
